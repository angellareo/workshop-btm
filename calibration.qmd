## How to calibrate

### Method A: Calibration with resistors

For this first method, we are going to use a protoboard with a set of resistors (like the one in the image).

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Make sure you know the value of the resistors. If not, you can check the colors of the resistors and use [this calculator](https://www.calculator.net/resistor-calculator.html).

### Method B: Calibration with samples

This method simulates precipitation.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: A spray that emits known quantities of water is required. Ideally, distilled (or low mineralization) water should be used.

1. We start from a very dry sample.
2. We wet the sample with the spray once.
3. Measure (time and resistance)
4. If the sample has not saturated, repeat from 2.
5. If the sample saturates (constant resistance), we stop.
