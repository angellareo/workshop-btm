# 1. Why a BtM?

-   **Problem to solve:** Existing commercial solutions were expensive and did not fully meet our specific needs. They offered limited flexibility and closed architectures, which constrained our research applications.

-   **Our approach: Free/Libre and Open Source Development**\
    We chose to develop our own solution using open hardware and open software.

    Advantages include:

    -   Lower cost

    -   Transparency and reproducibility

    -   Full adaptability to specific research needs

    -   Collaborative improvement and customization

# 2. What is a BtM?

The BtM (Bryolichen Temperature Moisture board) is:

-   A **datalogger** with:

    -   A temperature/humidity sensor for ambient conditions

    -   **8 activity detection channels** based on soil or organism water content

### How do we measure "activity"?

-   **Water contentâ€“activity correlation:** Biological activity is closely related to water content in soils and substrates.

-   **Water content = Conductance:** By measuring **electrical conductance**, we estimate water content, which serves as a proxy for activity.

-   BtM includes both **software and hardware** components, all completely open and free.

#### Hardware Demonstration

-   We will show the BtM device in both **field and laboratory** setups.\
    *(Include photo of the open BtM case)*

#### Software Demonstration

-   We will explore the code used to operate and analyze data with the BtM.
