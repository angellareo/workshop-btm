## Get the Printed Circuit Board (PCB)

-   The PCB can be (depending on budget and skills):
    -   Assembled from scratch (DIY)
    -   Provided as a partially assembled board.

## Key Components:

## How conductance is measured:

Measures are based on **Ohmâ€™s Law**. Ohmâ€™s Law relates voltage (*V*), current (*I*), and resistance (*R*):

$$
V = I \cdot R
$$
Although measures are taken as resistance values (in $\ohm$), it is commonly plotted as conductance values. There is a direct inverse relation between impedance (R) and conductance (G): 
$$    
G = \frac{1}{R} 
$$



### Voltage Divider

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
import {Inputs, md} from "@observablehq/inputs"

viewof Vin = Inputs.range([0, 10], {
  label: "Input Voltage (V)",
  value: 5,
  step: 0.1
})

viewof R1 = Inputs.range([100, 10000], {
  label: "Resistance R1 (Î©)",
  value: 1000,
  step: 100
})

viewof R2 = Inputs.range([100, 10000], {
  label: "Resistance R2 (Î©)",
  value: 1000,
  step: 100
})

md`**ðŸ”‹ Output Voltage (Vout):** \`${(Vin * R2 / (R1 + R2)).toFixed(2)} V\``
```

### Additional Hardware (Beyond PCB)

-   Arduino Board (serves as microcontroller)
-   Temperature/Humidity Sensor:\
    Two versions available; we will discuss the pros and cons of each, including a current issue with one of the sensor models.
