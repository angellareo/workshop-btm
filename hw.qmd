## 2.1 Hardware Details

### Printed Circuit Board (PCB)

-   The BtM PCB can be (depending on budget and skills):
    -   Assembled from scratch (DIY)
    -   Provided as a partially assembled board.
-   Key Components:
    -   

        ![PCB schematic showing its different parts](img/assembly-schematic.png)
-   How conductance is measured:
    -   Based on *Ohmâ€™s Law*:
    -   Relation between impedance (R) and conductance (C): ( G = \frac{1}{R} )

### Additional Hardware (Beyond PCB)

-   Arduino Board (serves as the microcontroller)
-   Temperature/Humidity Sensor:\
    Two versions available; we will discuss the pros and cons of each, including a current issue with one of the sensor models.
