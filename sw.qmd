## Arduino IDE

-   To program the BtM, we use an Arduino IDE

![Screenshot of BtM code](img/arduino-ide.png)

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You can only load one code at a time. After the Arduino is programmed, the same code will run each time you turn on the datalogger.

-   Date/time, temperature, humidity, and resistance
-   Customizable logging interval
-   CSV log files: We'll see the structure in a moment

### Saving data

-   BtM saves data in 11 columns in a .csv file to the Micro SD card
-   To obtain the CSV file, SD card has to be physically extracted

-   Date/Time
-   Temperature (ºC)
-   Relative Humidity (%)
-   8 impedance columns with the value of each activity channel (ohm)
    -   low values (\< 100) indicate the sample is moist, high values (\> 10,000) indicate the sample is wet (these values are resistance-dependent).
